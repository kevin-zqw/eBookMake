<p>Would you be kind enough to furnish me with certain information regarding the Contract between the school and myself. Before I started for England from Peking in 1924, I signed it at Miss Wood's school, but I have never had an acknowlegement of it and I do not know whether she sent it to the school on to Dr. Rees. In the latter case, it is very probable that it was never dilivered to the school, as the death of Dr. Rees occured at that time. It is, I belive, the English custom for a Contract to be signed by both parties, and a copy kept by each with the other's signature. Since I do not know whether Miss Wood returned the copy with by signature of the authorization of the school. Now, I beg you to tell me, firstly, whether Miss Wood returned the contract, and secondly, I wish to have a copy signed by the school. Although I still remember all the Conditions of my Contract, yet, I wish to have a copy in my possession I should be much obliged, if you would be kind enough to accomplish my request.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your kind letter of April 21st.</p>

<p>About my next publication in English, I am now only anxious to work out the long novel I have been doing with Miss Ida Pruitt. It is a long novel about a million words in Chinese. The first two parts of it were already published in book from in Shanghai, and I am now writing its third part, which will, I hope, be completed in two months time. The story is about war time in Peking covering a period of eight long years. Personally, I myself like it very much, as it is my longest, and perhaps also my best novel I have ever Written. For the English version, it is quite necessary to boil down a bit, and I intend to cut off two hundred thousand words at least.</p>

<p>I have, so far, not tried to make any arrangement for its publication with my publisher, although Mr.Amussen once told me to make a contract with Mr.Reynal. I would be very glad indeed, if we could get for it another publisher.</p>

<p>Miss Ida Puritt was born in China on which she has published two books in her own right. Although she does not read Chinese that she can visualize all what I read to her at once from my book. That is the reason why I have been very happy in working with her.</p>

<p>She has, however, her shortcomings. She would, for example, insist to keep the Chinese flavor as much as she can which makes her sometimes write broken English. When I gave the draft of the first ten chapters of the translation to Miss Herz to read, she told me to stop working with Miss Pruitt at once, as she thought the English was all very queer. And she also made the remark that if I were to continue working with Miss Pruitt, it would be quite necessary to get a third person to polish up the English, which would make things very complicated. I believe that is where Mr.Reynal got the impression of vowing it aside as premature.</p>

<p>I went, then, to see Mrs.Walsh and asked her advise about it. After her reading of the same ten chapters, she told me to go ahead with Miss Pruitt. Her opinion is that she likes the story and all the slips and mistakes made by Miss Pruitt can be easily corrected by a competent editor.</p>

<p>This is about all I can tell you at the moment and I hope we will soon have a talk together.</p>

<p>With best wishes,</p>

<p>Mr.Amussen of Reynal &amp; Hitchcock has just returned from the country where he worked on the draft of Divorce for three weeks with some minor corrections here and there. He told me yesterday on the phone that the book will be all ready for the public by November,1948.</p>

<p>I believe Miss Pruitt is right in thinking that a translation would be disintegrated when handled by somebody else besides the translator. I myself would like to see it all to be done by herself alone and pay her twenty-five percent as she suggested,</p>

<p>With my limited knowledge of the English language, I am no fair judge of her style of writing. Therefore, I have to take the risk to depend on her. It seems that to insist to have a third person cutting in now would certainly hurt her pride which I would never do to a friend. So let us give in, and I hope she would be more confident with herself in writing on the strength of our trust of her.</p>

<p>She is now away for ten days holiday. I hope we will sign up the agreement you drafted and revised for us when she comes back to town.</p>

<p>After this revision, I do think the story is in good shape. I do hope that Amussen will do the final reading of the revised manuscript quickly and put it forward to the press before long.</p>

<p>I suppose Kings argument would base on two facts: 1. there is no copyright laws agreement between China and America. 2. Rickshaw Boy was copyrighted by him before I came over to this country.

<p>I have not about me a copy of the movie rights contract. But what Mr.Hostater said is all correct.</p>

<p>The whole bussiness with Wang Howe is miserable indeed. I should have been asked to help to write the first screen play in the first place. But Wang just engaged a Hollywood man to do it alone. When the fifteen thousand screen script proved to be a dud, Wang began to remember me. He should then ask me to write it, yet he again engaged another man. The trouble is that all the money gathered to establish the independent movie company is not his, so he would just throw it away to show that he is the boss. I believe that when all the money is spent, he would wash his hand with the company and get some big jobs at the big companies.</p>

<p>So I don't think we should bother about the movie any more, unless I hear from them again. Suppose they would ask me again to see the second screen script, we should then ask them to pay seven hundred and fifty dollars a week for my labour. Don't you think so? With best wishes,</p>

<p>I write today to Mr.Amussen as following:</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I am to give up writing the Drum Singer story altogether. After I did twelve chapters, almost one half of the whole book, I begin to realize that it is not at all as good and interesting as I at first imagined. I have better to quit now so that I can have a rest I have needed badly.</p>

<p>"Judging from what Miss Kuo's agent said to Mr.Lloyd, it seems that Miss Kuo is not so keen in doing the translation either. I can very well imagine how hard it would be for a creative writer like her to pick up some other's ideas for her own.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry indeed that things should have turned out like this, but I am on the other hand happy in having a chance to relax for a few days."</p>

<p>The reason why I wrote is that since Miss Kuo's agent has been telling tales to Amussen, we should not keep silence all the time, The content of my letter will be good enough to show I have no ill feelings toward Miss Kuo. If by chance she could see or hear about my letter, she would perhaps be moved, as she has probably been thinking that we have been hard bargaining with her, but I said nothing about bargaining in the letter. If Amussen did say that she should share every penny we earn, my letter will show him in between the lines that once I stop writing, no matter how good a translator she is, she could not do a thing！</p>

<p>In case you have a chance to talk with Amussen and if he still thinks she should share all the money, please point out to him that the high percentage of forty share makes her share of other rights impossible.</p>

<p>I have just had a heart to heart talk with Miss Kuo and we both agreed that her share will be 40% including foreign rights. The film and other rights<span class="block">（drama and so on）</span>are to be kept by myself.</p>

<p>She suggests that we should get the agreement signed the sooner the better. I hope her agent will soon let you know all about it and we can sign the paper before long.</p>

<p>She also says that the letter I wrote to Amussen about my stopping writing the story can easily be explained away, and we should give the three sample chapters to Amussen to read.</p>

<p>She hopes that both the agreement between the author and translator and the contract for the book with the publisher could be worked out promptly so that she could settle down to do her work seriously. Otherwise, she would feel uncertain and could not do it properly.</p>

<p>Many many thanks for all the trouble and I hope everything will finally turn out satisfactory.</p>

<p>I hope I will be able to go to see you next Thursday, as I am going to New Haven for two days - Tuesday Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The three sample chapters of my new story have gone, as Miss Kuo told me, to Mr.Amussen. She has arranged with Mr.Amussen that she is to get a thousand dollars advance, to be paid directly to her agent in four installments, two hundred and fifty each, paid in four months, starting from the day when the contract is to be signed, so that’s that.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your letter of 9 Dec. 1948.</p>

<p>I have not been arranging terms for my new book with the publisher, as I know you are to handle it for me. Unfortunately, the three sample chapters and the outline went to Amussen. directly from Miss Kuo’s agent who also arranged the one thousand advance for her. I did not know a thing until she told me so. Her agent should have handed over the three chapters to you and told you about her advance, but he did not, which perhaps gave you the impression that I was responsible for them. That is the reason why I wrote you as I did last time. If I told you all the facts then, you would certainly feel annoyed with both Miss Kuo and Watkins.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I have been very careful to keep away from both Amussen and Reyal in order to let you negotiate for me without any interference. But I just could not stop either Kuo or Watkins going to the publisher directly. I hope this will make you more cheerful that there was no double-headed dealings from my part.</p>

<p>The three sample chapters now in the publisher's hand are the only clean copy. Since Miss Kou has to do all the typing herself, I would rather not ask her to do it again. You know how delicate it is to deal with a lady！</p>

<p>Your draft for the contract is all O.K. to me.</p>

<p>I hope we can get the contract properly signed pretty soon, as I know that Miss Kuo would not work any more on the book unless she sees I signed the contract and she got the advance.</p>
