Dear Miss Clegg
Would you be kind enough to furnish me with certain
information regarding the Contract between the school and myself.
Before I started for England from Peking in1924,1signed it at Miss
Wood's school,but I have never had an acknowlegement of it and I
do not know whether she sent it to the school on to Dr.Rees.In the
latter case,it is very probable that it was never dilivered to the
school, as the death of Dr.Rees occured at that time.It is,I belive,
the English custom for a Contract to be signed by both parties,and a
copy kept by each with the other's signature.Since I do not know
whether Miss Wood returned the copy with by signature of the
authorization of the school.Now,I beg you to tell me,firstly,
whether Miss Wood returned the contract,and secondly,I wish to
have a copy signed by the school.Although I still remember all the
Conditions of my Contract,yet,I wish to have a copy in my
possession I should be much obliged,if you would be kind enough to
accomplish my request.
Yours Sincerely,
C.C.Shu

I am sorry for giving you twice the wrong telephone number of

I am not sure whether Mr.Reynal is now in town or not,as I

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Many thanks for your kind letter of April21st.
About my next publication in English,I am now only anxious to
work out the long novel I have been doing with Miss Ida Pruitt.It is
a long novel about a million words in Chinese.The first two parts of
it were already published in book from in Shanghai,and I am now
writing its third part,which will,I hope,be completed in two
months time.The story is about war time in Peking covering a
period of eight long years.Personally,I myself like it very much,as it
is my longest,and perhaps also my best novel I have ever Written.
For the English version,it is quite necessary to boil down a bit,and I
intend to cut off two hundred thousand words at least.
I have,so far,not tried to make any arrangement for its publica
-tion with my publisher,although Mr.Amussen once told me to
make a contract with Mr.Reynal.I would be very glad indeed,if we
could get for it another publisher.
Miss Ida Puritt was born in China on which she has published
two books in her own right.Although she does not read Chinese that
she can visualize all what I read to her at once from my book.That is
the reason why I have been very happy in working with her.
She has,however,her shortcomings.She would,for example,
insist to keep the Chinese flavor as much as she can which makes her
sometimes write broken English.When I gave the draft of the first
ten chapters of the translation to Miss Herz to read,she told me to
stop working with Miss Pruitt at once,as she thought the English
was all very queer.And she also made the remark that if I were to
continue working with Miss Pruitt,it would be quite necessary to get
a third person to polish up the English,which would make things
very complicated.I believe that is where Mr.Reynal got the
impression of vowing it aside as premature.
I went,then,to see Mrs.Walsh and asked her advise about it.
After her reading of the same ten chapters,she told me to go ahead
with Miss Pruitt.Her opinion is that she likes the story and all the
slips and mistakes made by Miss Pruitt can be easily corrected by a
competent editor.
This is about all I can tell you at the moment and I hope we will
soon have a talk together.
With best wishes,
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I had a letter this morning from Reynal and Hitchcock telling
me to give them a letter for their files in the matter of the change of
agent on my contract for Divorce.
Do you think the following will do？
This will notify you that Heuriette Herz has resigned as my
agent and in her stead I have appointed David Lloyd to act as agent
for my novel Divorce and to dispose of all those properties arising
out of the book in which Reynal and Hitchcock have no share.All
monies due me under the terms of the contract between Reynal and
Hitchcock and myself,dated Sept.24,1940are to be paid directly to
......at.......
I am leaving those two spaces blank in the final sentence,for I
do not know whether you would be so kind as to collect money for
me from the earnings form Ricksham Boy.（contract dated Sept.24,
1946.）
If you think my suggestion is all right,please type this out for
me,as I am sorry that I do not know how to type myself.
I should be very glad indeed if you and Miss Lloyd and the lady
I met the other day at your office would come and dine with me
some day next week.Monday evening will be the best for me.I want
to give you some real Chinese food somewhere around Times Square,
if you care for Chinese cooking.
Yours Sincerely.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I am going to the country for a few days and will be back to
town about the24th of the present month.
I will probably be able to finish the reading of my long novel
with Miss Ida Pruitt in about2weeks after my return from the
country.
Would you be so kind as to have a talk with Miss Pruitt when I
am away,as I am afraid she would be too shy to talk about money
matters in my presence.
Do you think whether it is advisable to offer her twenty percent
in case she is not satisfied with fifteen percent？
About the short story,I think we should let it go as it is,as
Miss Quong has already revised it three times.Do you think it would
do no harm if we just send it to,say,Harper,or any other magazine
in your mind,and see what will happen？
I will go to see you when I come back from the country.
With best wishes
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your letter of July20th,1948.
Mr.Amussen of Reynal&Hitchcock has just returned from the
country where he worked on the draft of Divorce for three weeks
with some minor corrections here and there.He told me yesterday on
the phone that the book will be all ready for the public by
November,1948.
I believe Miss Pruitt is right in thinking that a translation
would be disintegrated when handled by somebody else besides the
translator.I myself would like to see it all to be done by herself alone
and pay her twenty-five percent as she suggested,
With my limited knowledge of the English language,I am no
fair judge of her style of writing.Therefore,I have to take the risk to
depend on her.It seems that to insist to have a third person cutting
in now would certainly hurt her pride which I would never do to a
friend.So let us give in,and I hope she would be more confident
with herself in writing on the strength of our trust of her.
She is now away for ten days holiday.I hope we will sign up the
agreement you drafted and revised for us when she comes back to
town,
I returned from the country last Monday and I will be here up
to the4th of August when I will go away again for a few days.
Do please have a few day off,as it is really too hot to work here
in the city.
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your kind letter.About Ward’s
doings,I have learned up till now nothing beyond what you told me
in your letter.
Miss Kuo,Mr.Amussen,and I together had a discussion over
Divorce the other day.Following Mr.Amussen's suggestions,I did
in two days all the necessary revisions.Miss Kuo liked my revisions
very much and promised to do promptly the English for them.She
could probably give them to Amussen next Monday.
After this revision,I do think the story is in good shape.I do
hope that Amussen will do the final reading of the revised
manuscript quickly and put it forward to the press before long.
If we could bring out the book quickly,it would,I imagine,help
a great deal to stop all Ward’s nonsense.If we could publish my
book before Ward’s“rare”一edition has the chance to steal the
scene,we would all be saved.
He would not dare to challenge us by scattering his“rare”一edi
—tion after the book properly published by us.
Yours Sincerely,

I am myself going to pay a visit to Mrs.Walsh in her farm
tomorrow.I will stay there only for4or5days.
I have already written to my publisher in Shanghai about the im

I had a chat on the phone with Mr.Amussen who said he had
received the English version of all the revisions of Divorce from Miss
Kuo and he was to prepare everything for the final draft promptly.I
do hope we can out—run Ward in this scandalous Olympics.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I am sorry for not having told you anything about my
Hollywood adventure,as I came back only last night.
When I left them,I did not mention how much they should pay
for my service,as they had already paid the round air trip and hotel
expenses for me which was altogether about four hundred dollars.All
they wanted to know from me was whether the screen script of my
story was of any good.
The script,written by a regular Hollywood screen writer,is
very very poor.After my telling them so,they are now thinking
whether they should engage another screen writer or have me to
work it out.
If they would ask me to do it,I should like to make an written
agreement with them,and of course I will come to you for advice.On
the other hand,if they hire another screen writer to do it,there will
be nothing to be said about it.
After Mr.Brown’s call,Mr.Hostater also called me on the
phone when I was out.I wonder whether Mr.Hostater knows that
Miss Herz has given up her work as an agent for good.
Many thanks for your kind letter.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your kind letter.
Yes,you are right in thinking that the question of Chinese copy
—right might become troublesome.My publisher at Shanghai has
just sent over Divorce's registration number from the Home Office
of China.I wonder whether it’s of a help.
I suppose Kings argument would base on two facts：1.there is
no copyright laws agreement between China and America.2.
Rickshaw Boy was copyrighted by him before I came over to this
country.If he could copyright Rickshaw Boy»he can do the same
with Divorce,I think we have better to dig up the contract of
Rickshaw Boy and see whether this is true.If it？s copyrighted by
the publisher,we are rather safer.
Miss Pruitt is still in the country.I will tell her about signing
the agreement as soon as I meet her.
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

The Chinese reads：

This is the re—registration of Divorce,as the original records of
registration is lost in the war.This is copyrighted in the author＾
name.And it covers all editions,because although there are quite a
few editions published in the past fifteen years,yet the book is
always the same.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your kind letter.
I have not about me a copy of the movie rights contract.But
what Mr.Hostater said is all correct.
The whole bussiness with Wang Howe is miserable indeed.I
should have been asked to help to write the first screen play in the
first place.But Wang just engaged a Hollywood man to do it alone.
When the fifteen thousand screen script proved to be a dud,Wang
began to remember me.He should then ask me to write it,yet he
again engaged another man.The trouble is that all the money
gathered to establish the independent movie company is not his,so
he would just throw it away to show that he is the boss.I believe
that when all the money is spent,he would wash his hand with the
company and get some big jobs at the big companies.
So I don't think we should bother about the movie any more,
unless I hear from them again.Suppose they would ask me again to
see the second screen script,we should then ask them to pay seven
hundred and fifty dollars a week for my labour.Don't you think so？
With best wishes,
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

Thank you very much for your kind letter of Oct.20,1948.
The Chinese word‘‘happy’’for“Happy boy”may also mean：Felici
-ty,good luck,good omen,and prosperity.I hope they will help the
Italian publisher make a good sounding name for the hero.“King”
alone has all the foreign rights of Rickshazv Boy,but I do not mind
giving one or two tips to the Italian publisher.Do you mind to ask
for a copy of the Italian translation for me when you write to the
publisher？
About the new novel,I have already done four chapters of
which three have gone to Miss Kuo to be translated.I should be very
grateful to you,if you would be so kind as to prepare some
agreement for us on the forty percent basis.If I can keep the rate of
doing two thousand words a day,as I have been doing in the past
few days,I think I can finish the whole thing somewhere at the New
Year time.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you for your kind letter.
Miss Kuo has given the draft of the first three chapters of the
Drum story to her agent to read.Her agent will give them to you to
be handed over to Mr.Amussen.Before you send them to Mr.
Amussen,I should like to have them typed out again in order to
made a clean copy which would look more business like.
About the agreement with Miss Kuo for the new book,I have
no other suggestion to make beyond that we should not yield
anything more than her participation of the book and serial rights.
With best wishes,
Yours Sincerely,

Thanksgiving day'48
Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I write today to Mr.Amussen as following：
“I am sorry that I am to give up writing the Drum Singer
story altogether.After I did twelve chapters,almost one half of the
whole book,I begin to realize that it is not at all as good and
interesting as I at first imagined.I have better to quit now so that I
can have a rest I have needed badly.
＾Judging from what Miss Kuo*s agent said to Mr.Lloyd,it
seems that Miss Kuo is not so keen in doing the translation either.I
can very well imagine how hard it would be for a creative writer like
her to pick up some other's ideas for her own.
WI am very sorry indeed that things should have turned out like
this,but I am on the other hand happy in having a chance to relax
for a few days.’’
The reason why I wrote is that since Miss Kuo*s agent has
been telling tales to Amussen,we should not keep silence all the
time,The content of my letter will be good enough to show I have
no ill feelings toward Miss Kuo.If by chance she could see or hear
about my letter,she would perhaps be moved,as she has probably
been thinking that we have been hard bargaining with her,but I said
nothing about bargaining in the letter.If Amussen did say that she
should share every penny we earn,my letter will show him in
between the lines that once I stop writing，no matter how good a
translator she is,she could not do a thing！
In case you have a chance to talk with Amussen and if he still
thinks she should share all the money,please point out to him that
the high percentage of forty share makes her share of other rights
impossible.
Seasonal Greetings.
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

26/11
Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I have just had a heart to heart talk with Miss Kuo and we both
agreed that her share will be40%including foreign rights.The film
and other rights（drama and so on）are to be kept by myself.
She suggests that we should get the agreement signed the
sooner the better.I hope her agent will soon let you know all about it
and we can sign the paper before long.
She also says that the letter I wrote to Amussen about my
stopping writing the story can easily be explained away,and we
should give the three sample chapters to Amussen to read.
She hopes that both the agreement between the author and
translator and the contract for the book with the publisher could be
worked out promptly so that she could settle down to do her work
seriously.Otherwise,she would feel uncertain and could not do it
properly.
Many many thanks for all the trouble and I hope everything
will finally turn out satisfactory.
I hope I will be able to go to see you next Thursday,as I am
going to New Haven for two days—Tuesday Thursday morning.
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
The three sample chapters of my new story have gone,as Miss
Kuo told me,to Mr.Amussen.She has arranged with Mr.Amussen
that she is to get a thousand dollars advance,to be paid directly to
her agent in four installments,two hundred and fifty each,paid in
four months,starting from the day when the contract is to be
signed,so that’s that.
As for my own advance,please do what you think is the best,
It’s no difference to me whether the one thousand and five hundred
dollars will be paid all at once or in installments.
Best wishes,
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your letter of9Dec.1948.
I have not been arranging terms for my new book with the
publisher,as I know you are to handle it for me.Unfortunately,the
three sample chapters and the outline went to Amussen.directly from
Miss Kuo’s agent who also arranged the one thousand advance for
her.I did not know a thing until she told me so.Her agent should
have handed over the three chapters to you and told you about her
advance,but he did not,which perhaps gave you the impression that
I was responsible for them.That is the reason why I wrote you as I
did last time.If I told you all the facts then,you would certainly feel
annoyed with both Miss Kuo and Watkins.
As a matter of fact,I have been very careful to keep away from
both Amussen and Reyal in order to let you negotiate for me without
any interference.But I just could not stop either Kuo or Watkins
going to the publisher directly.I hope this will make you more
cheerful that there was no double—headed dealings from my part.
The three sample chapters now in the publisher's hand are the
only clean copy.Since Miss Kou has to do all the typing herself,I
would rather not ask her to do it again.You know how delicate it is
to deal with a lady！
Your draft for the contract is all O.K.to me.
I hope we can get the contract properly signed pretty soon,a«s I
know that Miss Kuo would not work any more on the book unless*
she sees I signed the contract and she got the advance.
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

where cows,instead of policemen,stand right in the middle of the
highway.Miss Kuo did not kill a single cow,though.
She has gone to the country,seven miles away from Miami to
do her work.I am staying in Hotel Flagler,a small,clean hotel with
moderate price.It’s very warm here and I hope it will do some good

pain gets more acute day by day.He told me this morning that he
was to send me to Beth Israie.I will let you know whether it is
necessary to have an operation when I get there.
The first complete draft of the translation of the Drum Singers
has been sent to me.I hope I can go through it before my
hospitalization.Mr.Amussen also has a copy of it.When he finishes
reading of it,I will compare notes with him to make the final draft.
Did you send the short story we submitted to Harper*s to
England for me？
Mr.Chien gave me the other day a copy of the contract for the

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your kind letter.
Miss Pruitt and I spent a week end at her brother*s home in
Philladelphia.Walking with her in the wood,I got a rather good title
for the Four Generations story—Yellovu Storm.Do you like it？
I am going to see Mr.Amussen Thursday Morning and I will
let you know about the Drum Singers story and everything.
With best wishes,
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I am sorry that I did not write as soon as landed in Hongkong
on Nov.4th.The ship was twice caught by typhoon and several days
after my landing I still felt my bed rolling and shaking.The rough
sea brought back to me all my sciatic pain.I can hardly walk at all
even now.Hongkong University is built on the hills which gives me
a terrible pain every time I try to go out.
After staying here for ten days,I still do not know when I will
be able to go to Peking,as there are so many people waiting to sail
for the North that to secure a passage is extremely diffucult.I have
to wait for a while here,as I could hardly swim all the way home.
It would be very kind of you if you would tell Mr.Amussen and
Miss Pruitt about my arrival of Hongkong and all my misery,as it is
very painful for me to write more than one letter at a time.I will
write them when I get better.
Please give my kind regards to Mrs.and Miss Lloyd.
With best wishes,
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I have been here in Hongkong more than two weeks,yet I still
could not get a passage for the North.In the meanwhile,the pain
gets worse and worse everyday,and I can hardly walk at all.An
English friend is trying to get a ticket for me for Tientsin,But I
doubt very much whether he could succeed,as thousand and
thousand people all want ticket to get away from Hongkong.
Please give the enclosed paper to Mr.Amrssen and tell him that
I am in a mess.
Plese remember me to Mrs.and Miss Lloyd.

Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I am very sorry for not having written for so long—I have been
here in my home city already more than two months.Ever since I
came back to Peking,I have been very busy in reading and writing.
All the times I want to go and see more places in order to gather
some material for writing,but my sciatic pain is still with me and I
have to stay in everyday,and I can only get new ideas from reading.
After fifteen years separation,my three sisters（seventy——three,
seventy,and sixty four years old）are all living in Peking and still
very healthy.My big brother is here too.They are very happy indeed
to see their youngest brother coming back home.Two years ago,my
brother was almost dead of starvation.Now,his sons are all working
and my brother is right again.So they all love the new government
which is really good to the people.
My family is coming from Chungching.I have to get a house for
them.Now,Peking is the capital again,to find a suitable house is
rather expensive and difficult.I should be very much obliged,if you
would send me some five hundred dollars to Hongkong where Dr.
Hou will transmit them to me.（Dr.Hou Pao-chang,Dept,of
Pathology,Hongkong University,Hongkong）
How is the long novel going on？I am told that Mr.Amussen is
no longer with R.and H..Is that true？Have you seen Miss Pruitt？
Please remember me to Mrs.and Miss Lloyd kindly.

Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I am very sorry for not having written for so long,as I have
been very busy both in writing and in organizing the Artist's
Association of Peking.I have just managed to finish a five-acts play
which is going to be put on the stage before long.
Thank you very much for sending the sum of five hundred
dollars to Hongkong where Dr.Hou has managed to re—transmit to
me.I am happy to learn that the manuscript of the Four Generation
story is now in good shape.Please tell Mis Pruitt that I have been so
very busy that I could hardly find time to write to her.Please also
tell her that all the lakes and streams of Peking have been worked
upon so that clean and fresh water now runs everywhere.The wheat
harvest is better than last year and the famine is almost over.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Many thanks for your kind letter of9August,1950.
The five～acts play is now in the hand of a director who will
present it on the stage in September.Another shorter play of mine is
also going to be produced in Peking in December.The Association of
Writers and Artists of Peking has been properly organized and I am
now the chairman of it.It gives me a lot of work to do and I am very
busy indeed.
It has been very hot this summer,but for the last two days it
gets cooler,and pears,apples,and peaches are plenty in the market.
My little girl（Little Li）refuses everything except apples！She even
hides one or two apples in her bed！
Things in Peking are mostly going fine.Inflation is stopped and
everybody feels happy.Food is plenty.People begin to love the new
government.
About Harcurt Brace*s proposal of sharing the extra editorial
costs,I think we have to accept,as they have spent so much that we
should help them.
Please kindly post the enclosed card together with S15to Mr.
Robert Landry,the Authors Guild,3East39th Street,New York
16，N·Y.Many thanks.
Please remember me kindly to Mrs.and Miss Lloyd.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
This is to wish you a happy X*mas and a bright New Year.
I have been quite busy in my work,and that is the reason why I
have not been able to write.
My sciatic pains are still with me,otherwise,I am quite well.I
have tried to seek every possible advice to cure it,but all in vain.I
wonder when and how I can get rid of this troublesome thing.
I hope you have been keeping well.
Please kindly remember me to Mrs.and Miss Lloyd.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Peking,1951,May3rd
Thank you very much for your letter of April3,1951.1am very
sorry for not having written for so long,as I have been extremely
busy at the time.As the Chairman of the Peking Association of
Artists,I have so much to do that I could hardly find time enough to
manage even my own affairs.The population of Peking is now more
than2millions and many,many artists are working here.I have to
be busy to help them.
I am very anxious to see the Yellow Storm,but I do not know
when I could get one of the copies you sent to me.I hope you will be
kind enough to give two copies to Mr.T.T.Chu（435,apartment
52,W.123rd Street,New York,N.Y.）,one for himself,one for
me.He will get my copy through Hongkong to reach me.You may
send things and money to me in the same way.Mr.Chu is my good
friend and knows how to send them to me.
Miss Pruitt has sent me a few reviews of the Yellow Storm.
They seem to be very favorable indeed.

Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
The enclosed notice was forwarded to me by my former
landlord in New York.When I left New York,I brought all my
income tax documents to the Internal Revenue Office in42nd Street
to be examined.They were proved to be all correct and proper.
Otherwise,I could not book my passage for China at all.Now,I am
in Peking and I have,of course,no way to appear as told.Do you
think there is anything really important that we should do something
or just leave it alone？
I am told that one of the book（Yelloxv Storm）you sent to me
already reached Hongkong and my friend Dr.Hou will find a way to
send it to me.Mr.T.T.Chu of435W.123Street,Apt.52,New
York，N.Y.will help you to send letters,books,and money to me.
He is a good frined of mine.He can put the Chinese words on the
envelop for your letter to me.
I have been very busy all the time in Peking.But the sciati。
pain is still with me.I have tried everything to cure it,but nothing
doing！
Our white cat has now three babies-1all white,and2white
with yellow spots.But the small bird is dead which gives the
opportunity to my baby daughter to shed a lot of tears.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your kind letter of June28,1951.
This summer is a hot one for Peking.I can only write in the
early morning and it is too hot for me to work in the afternoon.
There are many beautiful parks where I can rest and get some cool
air,but I cannot get there,as my sciatic pain is still with me.For the
last three months I only worked out a short script for a movie and
nothing else.
About new China,there are one thousand and one things to be
said,but one word is really enough：the government is good.The Chi
—nese people just do not understand why the American government
strikes against the good government in Peking but support the bad
one in Formosa.
I am very glad to learn that the Yelloiv Storm is going to be
published in England for which I thank you very much.
Plesse give five hundred dollars or so to Mr.T.T.Chu whose
family will pay me.His family is now in Peking.
With the best wishes to you and to your family.
Yours Sincerely,
S.Y.Shu

Papers are signed by myself.I hope you will find them in gcxxl
order.I thank you very much for helping me and I hope the matter

before long.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I received another letter from the Treasury Dept,through
Hongkong together with two forms to be filled up.I really do not
know how to fill them.All I can do is to sign them.It would be very
kind of you indeed if you would let them know that you have a
power of attorney to look after the matter.
I am still very very busy in doing another play and I do not
know when I can finish it.The new society inspires creative writings
throughout the whole country and every writer is busy to do
something.The long winter is almost over.Peking is very beautiful
in the Spring.I will have plenty of flowers to take care which will
give me a chance to rest in between my works.My sciatic pain is
slightly better and I need some light exercise.Watering flowers is
just the right thing for me.
I will write again before long.

Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
Thank you very much for your kind letter of March7,1952.
The Drum Singers reached me two days ago.I wonder whether it
will have a good market,as the price is high and the book itself is
weak.I should be very grateful to you if you would care to send me a
few of the reviews of the book.Most of the reviews of Yellow
Storm are extremely flattering.I doubt whether the Drum book will
be so kindly received.
I have been very busy all the time,but I am glad to let you
know that my sciatic trouble is slightly better—the result of Vitamin
B injec tions.

Dear Mr.Lloyd,
I am sorry that this is going to be a very short note,as I am
very busy in doing many things at once.
Niu Tien Tgu is one of my minor works not worthy to be
translated.I know nothing about Mr.Collier and his intention.Please
tell Harcourt and Brace that this book is not a good one,and if any
other publisher wants it,it must be managed by you as you are my
agent for all my works to be published in U.S.A.
Best wishes from
Yours Sincerely,
